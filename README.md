# SDSS_fits_cutout

Easy download cutout fits images from the SDSS (www.sdss.org) database. This script is based on the DSS_pleiades_mosaic script 
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/howto/DSS_pleiades_mosaic.html

The python script shows how to use the make_lupton_rgb() function in astropy to convert the fits files to a regular rgb image roughly following the schema used to produce the SDSS sky images.
