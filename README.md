# SDSS_fits_cutout

Easy download cutout fits images from the SDSS (www.sdss.org) database. This script is based on the DSS_pleiades_mosaic script

Since quite some time I have been trying to get image cutouts from the SDSS in fits format. The jpg images in the cutout service are ok for simple tasks but nothing serious. Recently a colleague told me about Montage, a great tool to automate fits cutout, mosaic generation, coverage masks etc. Since Montage doesn’t include a script to retrieve SDSS cutouts in a simple way (there is actually one but I could not make it run) I wrote the following bash script based on Inseok Song’s pleiades script.

You need to install Montage first and add Montage’s bin folder to your PATH

Download and install Montage:

http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/

Add Montage’s bin folder to your path, this can be done in your .bashrc file. My Montage installation is in /home/miguel/Packages/Montage:

```bash
export PATH="/home/miguel/Packages/Montage/bin:$PATH"
```


The included python script (make_fits.py) shows how to use the make_lupton_rgb() function in the astropy library to convert the fits files to a regular rgb image roughly following the schema used to produce the SDSS sky images.
